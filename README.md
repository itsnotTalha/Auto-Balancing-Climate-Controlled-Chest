# Main Features:
## 1. Dual-Axis Stabilization:
MPU6050 senses movement; Raspberry Pi corrects tilt via MG996R servos through PCA9685 to keep the platform balanced.
## 2.Temperature & Humidity Regulation:
DHT22 continuously monitors conditions. The Peltier module cools or heats as required, supported by a fan for heat dissipation.
## 3.Data Display & Wireless Monitoring:
Real-time data is shown on the LCD and transmitted wirelessly to smartphones or cloud for IoT-based observation.

## 4.Optimized Power Management:
The Peltier activates only when needed, reducing energy waste and maintaining safety and sustainability.

1. MPU6050 sends continuous tilt and motion data to Raspberry Pi.
2. Raspberry Pi calculates corrections and adjusts servos via PCA9685.
3. DHT22 measures temperature/humidity; the Pi controls Peltier and fan accordingly.
4. Data is logged locally and wirelessly shared for monitoring.
5. Alerts are generated when readings exceed safe limits.

# Applications:
Medical logistics (vaccines, blood, organs), research labs, defense, and industrial transport requiring vibration-free and controlled environments.
